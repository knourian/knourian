I am a software engineer with expertise in programming, web development, and database development using C# and .NET Core. I have a passion for developing high-performance, scalable, and secure systems that solve complex challenges.

I have experience in using tools such as Git and Agile methodologies to work well in a team environment and deliver reliable code. I also have successful projects and contributions to open-source communities, including publishing my first NuGet package.

I am always looking for opportunities to learn new technologies, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and work on challenging projects that make a significant impact. I have strong analytical and problem-solving skills that enable me to deliver quality software that meets customer expectations.
